The dataset provided included various statistics related to income and health by state.  I chose to explore the relationship between poverty rates and both obesity and smoking.  The poverty rate remains static on the y-axis, with the viewer selecting either the obsesity percentage or the smoking percentage to compare it with.  Upon selecting one of the options, the x-axis adjusts to the proper range, with the circles indicating the state adjusting accordingly.
