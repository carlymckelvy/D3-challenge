# D3-challenge

The dataset provided included various statistics related to income and health by state.  I chose to explore the relationship between poverty rates and both obesity and smoking.  The poverty rate remains static on the y-axis, with the reader selecting either the obsesity percentage or the smoking percentage to compare it with.  Upon selecting one of the options, the x-axis adjusts to the proper range, with the circles indicating the state adjusting accordingly.  The reader is also able to hover the mouse over any state circle and have the appropriate state name and data displayed.
